# Robotic Waste Collection and Classification Simulation

**Mini CS Project â€“ Conceptual System for South Africa's Waste and Recycling Challenges**

## Problem: Waste Generation and Management

* South Africa produces enormous waste volumes each year, straining municipal systems.
* A significant portion of waste goes uncollected, leading to illegal dumping and pollution.
* Many landfill sites do not meet environmental standards, exacerbating health and ecosystem impacts.
* Innovative, sustainable waste management solutions are urgently needed to address this growing crisis.

## Problem: Recycling and Infrastructure Gaps

* Only a small fraction of waste is recycled; most ends up in landfills or is mismanaged.
* Public awareness and recycling culture are weak, with limited incentives to encourage recycling.
* Formal recycling initiatives are under-resourced and often unfunded, slowing progress.
* A large informal recycling sector (waste pickers, buy-back centers) already exists, indicating potential if scaled and supported.

## Proposed Solution: Robots & Simulation

* Develop an automated system where robots navigate a simulated map to collect, classify, and dispose of waste.
* The simulation models the environment as a graph: nodes = locations (neighborhoods, bins) and edges = paths between them.
* Robots use sensors to detect waste; an onboard AI model classifies each item (plastic, metal, etc.) in real time.
* Simulation allows testing strategies (robot coordination, waste distributions) before field deployment, aligning with calls for alternative waste management methods.

## Methodology: Graph-based Map Design

* Represent the target region as a graph of nodes (e.g., city blocks or waste collection points) and edges (roads or paths).
* This abstraction simplifies path planning: robots navigate by moving from node to node along edges.
* The graph model is easily extensible to add new areas or obstacles and visualize coverage.

## Methodology: Robot Navigation

* Each robot travels along graph edges using path-planning algorithms (e.g., shortest-path routing, heuristic search).
* Robots can coordinate to cover different parts of the map efficiently, reducing overlap.
* At each node, sensors check for waste. If found, the robot pauses to classify and pick up items.

## Methodology: Waste Classification

* Robots capture images of detected waste items (using cameras or sensors).
* A Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) model classifies each item. The image is over-segmented into regions to form a graph.
* Each graph node is a superpixel with features (color, texture). Edges link adjacent regions, encoding spatial structure.
* The GCN processes this graph to label the waste (plastic, metal, etc.), guiding robot disposal actions.

## Graph Convolutional Networks for Classification

* GCNs generalize CNNs to graph-structured data, enabling image inputs to be treated as graphs.
* In GCN-based image classification, an image is segmented into superpixels, each becoming a graph node.
* Edges connect spatially adjacent regions, allowing the model to capture both local and global image features.
* Rodrigues & Carbonera (2024) showed that such GCN approaches can classify images effectively by leveraging graph structure.
* We adapt their idea: waste images are turned into graphs for GCN-based classification of material type.

## Simulation Workflow

* Implement the system in a robotics simulation platform (e.g., Gazebo or custom environment).
* Initialize the graph-based map, place a set number of robots, and randomly distribute waste items across nodes.
* During each simulation cycle, robots move along edges, detect and classify waste at nodes, then transport items to disposal points.
* Track key outcomes qualitatively: coverage of area, proportion of waste collected, and classification accuracy (no numeric reporting here).
* Different scenarios (robot count, waste density) can be simulated to evaluate system behavior.

## Potential Impact

* Automating collection and sorting could boost recycling rates and reduce reliance on landfills.
* Simulation outcomes can guide infrastructure and policy decisions (e.g., placement of recycling bins, number of robots needed).
* Identifying waste hotspots in simulation can raise awareness and target cleanup efforts effectively.
* Ultimately supports cleaner environments and progress toward a circular economy in South Africa.

## Conclusion & Next Steps

* This conceptual system shows how robots and AI can address waste management challenges in South Africa.
* Next steps: implement the simulation, train the GCN with real waste image data, and refine robot coordination algorithms.
* Future work: real-world robot trials, integration with city infrastructure (smart bins, etc.), and expansion to other regions.
* Goal: inspire practical solutions and collaboration between technology and waste management stakeholders.
